# Trading View Simulator

This simulator mimics the functionality of receiving and processing trade data, similar to how a trading platform like TradingView operates. It's designed to help developers test and debug trading strategies within a controlled environment.

## Getting Started

To run the trading view simulator, ensure Docker is installed on your system, then execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
After starting the simulator, you can access the Django admin panel to manage and view the trading strategies:

[Admin Panel](http://localhost:8000/admin/trading/strategy/)
Login: admin
Password: pass

then go trading and update it
